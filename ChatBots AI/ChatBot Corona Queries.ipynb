      "\n",
      "The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[4] The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 and recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.[5] As of 16 March, more than 182,000 cases of the disease have been reported in over 160 countries and territories, resulting in more than 7,100 deaths and around 79,000 recoveries.[3] Regions affected by major outbreaks include mainland China, Europe, Iran, South Korea, and the United States.[3] On 13 March, the WHO stated that Europe had become the new epicentre of the pandemic.[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "The virus primarily spreads between people in a similar manner to influenza, via respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing.[7][8][9] People are thought to be most contagious when symptomatic, though some spread might be possible before symptoms show.[10][11] The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.[9][12] Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.[9][12] Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, but research is ongoing. Efforts are aimed at managing symptoms and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include handwashing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people (particularly those who are unwell), and monitoring and self-isolation for fourteen days for people who suspect they are infected.[8][9][13]\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts to prevent spread have included travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, event postponements and cancellations, and facility closures. These include a quarantine of Hubei, China; the nationwide quarantines of Italy, Spain, the Czech Republic, and Germany;[14] curfew measures in China and South Korea;[15][16][17] various border closures or incoming passenger restrictions;[18][19] screening methods at airports and train stations;[20] and travel advisories regarding regions with community spread.[21][22][23][24] Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in at least 61 countries, affecting around 600 million students.[25]\n",
      "\n",
      "Effects of the pandemic include social and economic instability,[26] xenophobia and racism against Chinese and East Asian people, closure of religious institutions, as well as the online spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus.[27][28][29]\n",
      "\n",
      "Epidemiology\n",
      "\n",
      "On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported by health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China,[147] and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.[148] These cases mostly had links to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals; consequently, the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.[149] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a new virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[150] pangolin coronaviruses[151] and SARS-CoV.[152] It is believed that the virus possibly originated in horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus).[153]\n",
      "\n",
      "The earliest person with symptoms was traced back to 1 December 2019, someone who did not have connections with the later cluster linked to the wet market.[154][155] Of the early cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.[1][156][157] On 14 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post said that a 55-year-old from Hubei province could have been the first person who contracted the disease on 17 November.[158][159] To date (14 March 2020), 67,790 cases and 3,075 deaths due to the virus have been reported in Hubei province, a case fatality rate (CFR) of 4.54%.[158]\n",
      "\n",
      "On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly dropped in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.[160]\n",
      "\n",
      "There may be substantial underreporting of cases, particularly among those with milder symptoms.[161][162] Reported numbers may also reflect local decisions on whom and when to test. As an example, on 13 March 2020, the UK reported 798 confirmed cases, but health officials estimated the actual number of people infected was probably between 5,000 and 10,000.[163]\n",
      "\n",
      "As of 26 February, \"very few\" cases have been reported among youth.[12] A report from the WHO noted that those 19 and under made up just 2.4 percent of cases worldwide.[164]\n",
      "\n",
      "Deaths\n",
      "\n",
      "Among those who died from the disease, the time from development of symptoms to death was between 6 and 41 days, with a median of 14 days.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "As of 16 March 2020 , more than 7,100 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.[3] According to China's NHC, most of those who died were elderly – about 80% of deaths were in those over 60, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.[165]\n",
      "\n",
      "The first confirmed death was on 9 January 2020 in Wuhan.[166] The first death outside China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[167][168] and the first death outside Asia was in France.[169] By 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of Iran, South Korea and Italy.[170][171][172] By 13 March, over 40 countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent (except Antarctica).[173]\n",

      "\n",
      "Further development can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death. Some of those infected may be asymptomatic, returning test results that confirm infection but show no clinical symptoms, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact to confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection.[1][179][180][181]\n",
      "\n",
      "The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to fourteen days; it is most commonly five days.[182][183] In one case, it had an incubation period of 27 days.[184]\n",
      "\n",
      "Cause\n",
      "\n",
      "Transmission\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets that people exhale, for example when coughing or sneezing.[7][185][186] Droplets stay suspended in the air for only a short time but may stay viable and contagious on a metal, glass or plastic surface.[187] Details for the virus are not available as of 26 February 2020 , and it is assumed that they are similar to other coronaviruses, which survive for up to nine days at room temperature.[188] Disinfection of surfaces is possible with substances such as 62–71% ethanol applied for one minute.[188]\n",
      "\n",
      "The WHO has stated that the risk of spread from someone without symptoms is \"very low\". However, if someone has beginning symptoms and a mild cough, there is a risk of transmission.[189]\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been estimates for the basic reproduction number (the average number of people an infected person is likely to infect), ranging from 2.13[190] to 4.82.[191][192] This is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV).[193]\n",

      "\n",
      "SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[194] It is thought to have a zoonotic origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[178][195] In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain genome sequences between the viruses found in pangolins and those from humans, implying that pangolins may have been an intermediate host.[196]\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnosis\n",
      "\n",
      "Infection by the virus can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, though confirmation is ultimately by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions (71% sensitivity) and CT imaging (98% sensitivity).[197]\n",
      "\n",
      "Viral testing\n",
      "\n",
      "The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with the first issued on 17 January.[198][199][200][201] Testing uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).[202] The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.[203] Results are generally available within a few hours to days.[204][205]\n",
      "\n",
      "A person is considered at risk if they have travelled to an area with ongoing community transmission within the previous 14 days, or have had close contact with an infected person. Common key indicators include fever, coughing and shortness of breath. Other possible indicators include fatigue, myalgia, anorexia, sputum production and sore throat.[206]\n",

      "Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include overall good personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, coughing/sneezing into a tissue and putting the tissue directly into a dustbin and (for those who may already have the infection) wearing a surgical mask in public.[209][210][211] Social distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.[212][213]\n",
      "\n",
      "Many governments advise against all non-essential travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak.[214] China has banned the trading and consumption of wild animals.[215]\n",

      "As of 13 March 2020, there is no COVID-19 vaccine though a number of organizations are working to develop one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Handwashing\n",
      "\n",
      "Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. It further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.[209] The WHO also advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[210][219]\n",
      "\n",
      "Respiratory hygiene\n",
      "\n",
      "Health organisations recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing (the tissue should then be disposed of immediately).[210][220]\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of surgical masks by those who may be infected has been recommended,[221][222][223] as they can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, sneezing and coughing.[224] The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.[225]\n",
      "\n",
      "Masks have also been recommended for use by those taking care of someone who may have the disease.[223] Masks are not recommended for most people. There is limited evidence that the wearing of surgical masks by uninfected people at low risk is effective,[223] although they may help people avoid touching their face. Surgical masks are the lowest grade of protection, and are designed mainly to protect others from the wearer. Masks designed to protect the wearer are technically \"respirators\", though calling them \"masks\" is common. Only China has specifically recommended the use of masks by healthy members of the public.[174][224][226] Nevertheless, face masks have been widely used by healthy people in Hong Kong,[227] Japan,[228] Malaysia,[229] and Singapore.[230][231]\n",
      "\n",
      "Social distancing\n",
      "\n",
      "Social distancing includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may also apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, not shaking hands, and physically distancing themselves from others.[233][234][235] Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.[236][237][238]\n",
      "\n",
      "Older adults and those with serious chronic conditions face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the US CDC to avoid crowds and stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.[239]\n",

      "Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.[240]\n",
      "\n",
      "It is presumed that the virus has reached the stage of community spread in large parts of the world. This means that the virus is spreading within communities whose members have not travelled to areas with widespread transmission. Government health agencies recommend that individuals self-isolate if they develop a continuous cough or a high-temperature fever. The self-isolation period should last for at least 14 days but preferably longer.[241] Additionally, individuals who have recently travelled to a country with widespread transmission or who have been in direct contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 have also been asked by some government health agencies to self-quarantine or practise social distancing for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.[8][9][242]\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Health Services has recommended that those self-quarantining at home stay two meters away from others within the household. Individuals undergoing self-quarantine should avoid contact with the elderly and chronically ill. People that self-quarantine should regularly wash their hands so that they don't spread the disease to others in the house or onto surfaces and objects that others will touch. As long as symptoms don't significantly worsen health services shouldn't be contacted.[240]\n",

      "\n",
      "There are two basic strategies in the control of an outbreak: containment and mitigation. Containment is done in the early stages of the outbreak, and aims to trace and isolate those infected to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage, when measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.[245]\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.[243] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.[243] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at social distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.[246]\n",
      "\n",
      "More drastic actions were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities affecting 60 million individuals in Hubei, and strict travel bans.[247] Other countries adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. For example, South Korea introduced mass screening, localised quarantines, and issuing alerts on the movements of affected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantine themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face-mask production, and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.[248] Some countries require people to report flu-like symptoms to their doctor, especially if they have visited mainland China.[249]\n",
      "\n",
      "Illness\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no specific antiviral medications, but development efforts are underway. Attempts to relieve the symptoms may include taking regular (over-the-counter) cold medications,[250] drinking fluids, and resting.[209] Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and breathing support may be required.[251] The use of steroids may worsen outcomes.[252] Several compounds, which were previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases, such as favipiravir, ribavirin, remdesivir,[253] and galidesivir, are being investigated.[254][255]\n",

      "History\n",
      "\n",
      "The first known case of the novel coronavirus was traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.[154] A later unconfirmed claim, citing Chinese government documents, suggests that the first victim was a 55-year-old man who fell ill on 17 November 2019.[256][under discussion] Within the next month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased to a couple hundred, before rapidly increasing in January 2020. On 31 December 2019, the virus had caused enough cases of unknown pneumonia to be reported to health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China,[147] and an investigation into the illness began early in the following month.[148] These were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals, consequently the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.[149]\n",
      "\n",
      "During the early stages, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[257] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration, with Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange in China; infected people quickly spread throughout the country.[178] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.[258] Later official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020.[259]\n",
      "\n",
      "On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.[260] Its director, Tedros Adhanom, has maintained his praise of China's response to the virus as of 24 February \"to avoid a significant number of cases\", despite the disease's potential to have sustained community transmission in other world regions.[261]\n",
      "\n",
      "On 13 March, the WHO declared Europe to be the new centre of the pandemic, after the rate of new cases in Europe surpassed those recorded in other regions of the world apart from China.[262] By 16 March 2020, the total number of cases reported around the world outside China had exceeded that of Mainland China.[263] As of 16 March 2020 , over 182,000 cases have been reported worldwide; more than 7,100 people have died; and over 79,000 have recovered.[3] There is thought to be a substantial underreporting of cases, particularly of cases with milder symptoms or no symptoms.[264][265]\n",

      "Within the United States, the White House has been accused for downplaying the threat and controlling the messages published by directing health officials and scientists to \"coordinating all statements and public appearances\" with the office of Mike Pence before publishing \"all coronavirus-related communications\".[480][481] Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told The New York Times that he was instructed by the White House not to talk about the coronavirus without clearance.[482] President of the United States Donald Trump has vowed to \"keep the numbers low\", leading to claims that he is trying to limit the magnitude of the published statistics.[483] On 4 March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States deleted the running tally of the number of people tested for the coronavirus across the US from its website. Allegations of a cover-up and concerns has risen that the deletion could possibly limit the country's response to the epidemic.[484]\n",

      "Misinformation and conspiracy theories\n",
      "\n",
      "After the initial outbreak, conspiracy theories and misinformation spread online regarding the origin and scale of the Wuhan coronavirus.[485] Various social media posts claimed the virus was a bio-weapon, a population control scheme, or the result of a spy operation.[486][487][488] Many media outlets, including Daily Mail and RT, promoted a video that purportedly showed a young Chinese woman in Wuhan eating a bat, suggesting the origin of COVID-19 to be human consumption of bat soup. However, it was later confirmed that the footage was filmed by travel vlogger Wang Mengyun in the island country of Palau in 2016, to showcase local cuisine.[489]\n",

      "On 2 February, the WHO declared there was a \"massive infodemic\" accompanying the outbreak and response, citing an overabundance of reported information, accurate and false, about the virus that \"makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.\" The WHO stated that the high demand for timely and trustworthy information has incentivised the creation of a direct WHO 24/7 myth-busting hotline where its communication and social media teams have been monitoring and responding to misinformation through its website and social media pages.[492][493]\n",

      "Taiwanese authorities have accused 50 Cent Party's internet trolls of spreading disinformation online to sow fear and panic among Taiwanese.[494][495] According to The Economist, conspiracy theories about COVID-19 being the CIA's creation to keep China down are all over the Chinese internet.[496][497] On 26 January, Chinese military news agency Xilu published an article detailing how the virus was artificially combined by the United States to \"precisely target Chinese people\".[498][499] Zhao Lijian, a spokesman from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, tweeted in March 2020 that the disease may have been introduced by members of the American Army who visited Wuhan in October 2019.[500] Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow and some members of the United States Congress have been accused of giving misinformation about the coronavirus.[501][502][503] Christopher Bouzy, the founder of Bot Sentinel, made a Twitter analysis for Inverse and found that GOP-linked trollbots \"are making an array of false claims\" about the coronavirus outbreak.[504] On 22 February, US officials said that they have discovered Russia-linked social media accounts deliberately promoting anti-American conspiracy theories on social media,[505][506] which was denied by Russia.[507]\n",

      "In a move which commentators consider state propaganda to deflect blame for poor handling of the epidemic, some officials, including a foreign ministry spokesman, the state news agency Xinhua, have protested at alleged \"politicisation\" of the outbreak by countries. Possibly prompted by a press conference on 27 February where Zhong Nanshan, a prominent expert, said that \"the coronavirus first appeared in China but may not have originated in China\", individual officials have echoed Xinhua's claim that \"The WHO has said many times that Covid-19 is a global phenomenon with its source still undetermined.\"[517][518][519] Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian sent out a tweet accusing the US Army of bringing the epidemic to Wuhan.[500]\n",

      "A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions. Some experts believe this is likely in a move to protect Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from people's anger over the coronavirus outbreak.[520] Some commentators have suggested that outcry over the disease could be a rare protest against the CCP.[521] Protests in Hong Kong have strengthened due to fears of immigration from mainland China.[522] Taiwan has also voiced concern over being included in any travel ban involving the People's Republic of China due to the \"one-China policy\" and Chinese claims.[523] A few countries have been using the epidemic to build political bridges with Beijing, raising accusations that these countries, which include Cambodia among others, were putting politics before health, attempting to use the outbreak to show tribute to the CCP.[524] Existing tensions between the US and China may have delayed a coordinated effort to combat the outbreak in Wuhan.[525]\n",

      "The coronavirus outbreak has been attributed to several instances of supply shortages, stemming from: globally increased usage of equipment to fight the outbreaks, panic buying and disruption to factory and logistic operations. The FDA has issued warnings about shortages to drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruption.[584] Several localities, such as the United States,[585] Italy[586] and Hong Kong,[587] also witnessed panic buying that led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, inducing supply shortages.[588] The technology industry in particular has been warning about delays to shipments of electronic goods.[589] According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment has risen 100-fold and this demand has led to the increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays on the supply of medical items for four to six months.[590][591] This has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.[592]\n",

Some analysts have estimated that the economic fallout of the epidemic on global growth could surpass that of the SARS outbreak.[593] One estimate gives a $300+ billion impact on world's supply chain that could last up to two years.[594] Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reportedly \"scrambled\" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China.[595] Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.[596][597] On 27 February, due to mounting worries about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indexes including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–08.[598] All three indexes ended the week down more than 10 percent.[599] On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a Negative Outlook.[600] Stocks plunged again based on coronavirus fears, the largest fall being on 16 March 2020.[601] Many consider an economic recession to be likely.[602][603][604]\n",

As a consequence, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.[605] Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.[606] The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday. A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.[607][608] Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.[609] In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most workplaces not to re-open until that date.[610][611] These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.[611] Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations.[612][613]\n",

      "Despite the high prevalence of coronavirus cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the ensuing high demand for food products, both areas have been spared from acute food shortages. Effective measures by China and Italy against the hoarding and illicit trade of critical products have been carried out with success, avoiding acute food shortages that were anticipated in Europe as well as in North America. Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not seen a large reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives. Empty food shelves were only encountered temporarily, even in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to assure sufficient nourishment of the population. Similar laws exist in Italy, that require food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.[614][615]\n",

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).', '[4] The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 and recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.', '[5] As of 16 March, more than 182,000 cases of the disease have been reported in over 160 countries and territories, resulting in more than 7,100 deaths and around 79,000 recoveries.', '[3] Regions affected by major outbreaks include mainland China, Europe, Iran, South Korea, and the United States.', '[3] On 13 March, the WHO stated that Europe had become the new epicentre of the pandemic.', '[6]\\n\\nThe virus primarily spreads between people in a similar manner to influenza, via respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing.', '[7][8][9] People are thought to be most contagious when symptomatic, though some spread might be possible before symptoms show.', '[10][11] The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.', '[9][12] Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.', '[9][12] Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.', 'There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, but research is ongoing.', 'Efforts are aimed at managing symptoms and supportive therapy.', 'Recommended preventive measures include handwashing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people (particularly those who are unwell), and monitoring and self-isolation for fourteen days for people who suspect they are infected.', '[8][9][13]\\n\\nEfforts to prevent spread have included travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, event postponements and cancellations, and facility closures.', 'These include a quarantine of Hubei, China; the nationwide quarantines of Italy, Spain, the Czech Republic, and Germany;[14] curfew measures in China and South Korea;[15][16][17] various border closures or incoming passenger restrictions;[18][19] screening methods at airports and train stations;[20] and travel advisories regarding regions with community spread.', '[21][22][23][24] Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in at least 61 countries, affecting around 600 million students.', '[25]\\n\\nEffects of the pandemic include social and economic instability,[26] xenophobia and racism against Chinese and East Asian people, closure of religious institutions, as well as the online spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus.', '[27][28][29]\\n\\nEpidemiology\\n\\nOn 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported by health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China,[147] and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.', '[148] These cases mostly had links to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals; consequently, the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.', '[149] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a new virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[150] pangolin coronaviruses[151] and SARS-CoV.', '[152] It is believed that the virus possibly originated in horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus).', '[153]\\n\\nThe earliest person with symptoms was traced back to 1 December 2019, someone who did not have connections with the later cluster linked to the wet market.', '[154][155] Of the early cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.', '[1][156][157] On 14 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post said that a 55-year-old from Hubei province could have been the first person who contracted the disease on 17 November.', '[158][159] To date (14 March 2020), 67,790 cases and 3,075 deaths due to the virus have been reported in Hubei province, a case fatality rate (CFR) of 4.54%.', '[158]\\n\\nOn 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly dropped in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.', '[160]\\n\\nThere may be substantial underreporting of cases, particularly among those with milder symptoms.', '[161][162] Reported numbers may also reflect local decisions on whom and when to test.', 'As an example, on 13 March 2020, the UK reported 798 confirmed cases, but health officials estimated the actual number of people infected was probably between 5,000 and 10,000.', '[163]\\n\\nAs of 26 February, \"very few\" cases have been reported among youth.', '[12] A report from the WHO noted that those 19 and under made up just 2.4 percent of cases worldwide.', '[164]\\n\\nDeaths\\n\\nAmong those who died from the disease, the time from development of symptoms to death was between 6 and 41 days, with a median of 14 days.', '[12]\\n\\nAs of 16 March 2020 , more than 7,100 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.', \"[3] According to China's NHC, most of those who died were elderly – about 80% of deaths were in those over 60, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.\", '[165]\\n\\nThe first confirmed death was on 9 January 2020 in Wuhan.', '[166] The first death outside China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[167][168] and the first death outside Asia was in France.', '[169] By 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of Iran,

infected may either be asymptomatic or develop flu like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, or muscle pain.', 'The typical signs and symptoms and their prevalence, are shown in the corresponding table.', '[178]\\n\\nFurther development can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.', 'Some of those infected may be asymptomatic, returning test results that confirm infection but show no clinical symptoms, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact to confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection.', '[1][179][180][181]\\n\\nThe usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to fourteen days; it is most commonly five days.', '[182][183] In one case, it had an incubation period of 27 days.', '[184]\\n\\nCause\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nThe primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets that people exhale, for example when coughing or sneezing.', '[7][185][186] Droplets stay suspended in the air for only a short time but may stay viable and contagious on a metal, glass or plastic surface.', '[187] Details for the virus are not available as of 26 February 2020 , and it is assumed that they are similar to other coronaviruses, which survive for up to nine days at room temperature.', '[188] Disinfection of surfaces is possible with substances such as 62–71% ethanol applied for one minute.', '[188]\\n\\nThe WHO has stated that the risk of spread from someone without symptoms is \"very low\".', 'However, if someone has beginning symptoms and a mild cough, there is a risk of transmission.', '[189]\\n\\nThere have been estimates for the basic reproduction number (the average number of people an infected person is likely to infect), ranging from 2.13[190] to 4.82.', '[191][192] This is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV).', '[193]\\n\\nVirology\\n\\nMicroscopy image showing SARS-CoV-2.', 'The spikes on the outer edge of the virus particles resemble a crown, giving the disease its characteristic name.', 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.', '[152]\\n\\nSARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.', '[194] It is thought to have a zoonotic origin.', 'Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains.', 'It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).', '[178][195] In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain genome sequences between the viruses found in pangolins and those from humans, implying that pangolins may have been an intermediate host.', '[196]\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nInfection by the virus can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, though confirmation is ultimately by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions (71% sensitivity) and CT imaging (98% sensitivity).', '[197]\\n\\nViral testing\\n\\nThe WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with the first issued on 17 January.', '[198][199][200][201] Testing uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).', '[202] The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.', '[203] Results are generally available within a few hours to days.', '[204][205]\\n\\nA person is considered at risk if they have travelled to an area with ongoing community transmission within the previous 14 days, or have had close contact with an infected person.', 'Common key indicators include fever, coughing and shortness of breath.', 'Other possible indicators include fatigue, myalgia, anorexia, sputum production and sore throat.', '[206]\\n\\nImaging\\n\\nCharacteristic imaging features on radiographs and computed tomography have been described in a limited case series.', '[207] The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.', '[208] However, due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by PCR is of limited use in identifying COVID-19.', '[207]\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nInfographic by the United States CDC , describing how to stop the spread of germs.', 'Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include overall good personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, coughing/sneezing into a tissue and putting the tissue directly into a dustbin and (for those who may already have the infection) wearing a surgical mask in public.', '[209][210][211] Social distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.', '[212][213]\\n\\nMany governments advise against all non-essential travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak.', '[214] China has banned the trading and consumption of wild animals.', '[215]\\n\\nHealth care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions with eye protection.', '[216]\\n\\nContact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.', '[217] Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection, for example: rinsing the nose, gargling with mouthwash and eating garlic are not effective.', '[218]\\n\\nAs of 13 March 2020, there is no COVID-19 vaccine though a number of organizations are working to develop one.', 'Handwashing\\n\\nHandwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.', \"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing.\", 'It further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.', '[209] The WHO also advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.', '[210][219]\\n\\nRespiratory hygiene\\n\\nHealth organisations recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing (the tissue should then be disposed of immediately).', '[210][220]\\n\\nThe use of surgical masks by those who may be infected has been recommended,[221][222][223] as they can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, sneezing and coughing.', '[224] The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.', '[225]\\n\\nMasks have also been recommended for use by those taking care of someone who may have the disease.', '[223] Masks are not recommended for most people.', 'There is limited evidence that the wearing of surgical masks by uninfected people at low risk is effective,[223] although they may help people avoid touching their face.', 'Surgical masks are the lowest grade of protection, and are designed mainly to protect others from the wearer.', 'Masks designed to protect the wearer are technically \"respirators\", though calling them \"masks\" is common.', 'Only China has specifically recommended the use of masks by healthy members of the public.', '[174][224][226] Nevertheless, face masks have been widely used by healthy people in Hong Kong,[227] Japan,[228] Malaysia,[229] and Singapore.', '[230][231]\\n\\nSocial distancing\\n\\nSocial distancing includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals.', 'Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres.', 'Individuals may also apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, not shaking hands, and physically distancing themselves from others.', '[233][234][235] Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.', '[236][237][238]\\n\\nOlder adults and those with serious chronic conditions face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the US CDC to avoid crowds and stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.', '[239]\\n\\nSelf-isolation\\n\\nSelf-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.', '[240]\\n\\nIt is presumed that the virus has reached the stage of community spread in large parts of the world.', 'This means that the virus is spreading within communities whose members have not travelled to areas with widespread transmission.', 'Government health agencies recommend that individuals self-isolate if they develop a continuous cough or a high-temperature fever.', 'The self-isolation period should last for at least 14 days but preferably longer.', '[241] Additionally, individuals who have recently travelled to a country with widespread transmission or who have been in direct contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 have also been asked by some government health agencies to self-quarantine or practise social distancing for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.', '[8][9][242]\\n\\nThe National Health Services has recommended that those self-quarantining at home stay two meters away from others within the household.', \"Individuals undergoing self-quarantine should avoid contact with the elderly and chronically ill. People that self-quarantine should regularly wash their hands so that they don't spread the disease to others in the house or onto surfaces and objects that others will touch.\", \"As long as symptoms don't significantly worsen health services shouldn't be contacted.\", '[240]\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nOutbreak\\n\\n[243][244] The goal of community mitigation, (1) delay outbreak peak (2) decompress peak burden on healthcare, known as flattening the curve (3) diminish overall cases and health impact.', 'There are two basic strategies in the control of an outbreak: containment and mitigation.', 'Containment is done in the early stages of the outbreak, and aims to trace and isolate those infected to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.', 'When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage, when measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.', 'A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.', '[245]\\n\\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.', '[243] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.', '[243] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at social distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.', '[246]\\n\\nMore drastic actions were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities affecting 60 million individuals in Hubei, and strict travel bans.', '[247] Other countries adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.', 'For example, South Korea introduced mass screening, localised quarantines, and issuing alerts on the movements of affected individuals.', 'Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantine themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.', 'Taiwan increased face-mask production, and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.', '[248] Some countries require people to report flu-like symptoms to their doctor, especially if they have visited mainland China.', '[249]\\n\\nIllness\\n\\nThere are no specific antiviral medications, but development efforts are underway.', 'Attempts to relieve the symptoms may include taking regular (over-the-counter) cold medications,[250] drinking fluids, and resting.', '[209] Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and breathing support may be required.', '[251] The use of steroids may worsen outcomes.', '[252] Several compounds, which were previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases, such as favipiravir, ribavirin, remdesivir,[253] and galidesivir, are being investigated.', '[254][255]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe first known case of the novel coronavirus was traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.', '[154] A later unconfirmed claim, citing Chinese government documents, suggests that the first victim was a 55-year-old man who fell ill on 17 November 2019.', '[256][under discussion] Within the next month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased to a couple hundred, before rapidly increasing in January 2020.', 'On 31 December 2019, the virus had caused enough cases of unknown pneumonia to be reported to health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China,[147] and an investigation into the illness began early in the following month.', '[148] These were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals, consequently the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.', '[149]\\n\\nDuring the early stages, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.', '[257] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration, with Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange in China; infected people quickly spread throughout the country.', '[178] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.', '[258] Later official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020.', '[259]\\n\\nOn 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.', '[260] Its director, Tedros Adhanom, has maintained his praise of China\\'s response to the virus as of 24 February \"to avoid a significant number of cases\", despite the disease\\'s potential to have sustained community transmission in other world regions.', '[261]\\n\\nOn 13 March, the WHO declared Europe to be the new centre of the pandemic, after the rate of new cases in Europe surpassed those recorded in other regions of the world apart from China.', '[262] By 16 March 2020, the total number of cases reported around the world outside China had exceeded that of Mainland China.', '[263] As of 16 March 2020 , over 182,000 cases have been reported worldwide; more than 7,100 people have died; and over 79,000 have recovered.', '[3]

restrictions.', 'Public transport was modified,[287][285] and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.', '[288][289] Some experts doubted the accuracy of the number of cases reported by the Chinese government, which repeatedly changed how it counted coronavirus cases.', '[290][291][292]\\n\\nThe early response by the Wuhan authorities was criticised as prioritising a control of information that might be unfavorable for local officials over public safety, and the Chinese government was also criticised for cover-ups and downplaying the initial discovery and severity of the outbreak.', '[293] By the time China had informed the WHO of the new coronavirus on 31 December, The New York Times reported that the government was still keeping \"its own citizens in the dark\".', '[294][295] Observers have also blamed the institutional censorship structure of the country\\'s press that left senior officials with inaccurate information on the outbreak and \"contributed to a
